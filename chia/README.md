### `chia` module overview

Following folders follow pattern in py-faster-rcnn:

* experiments
* models

Note: The `models` folder has prototxt files that CANNOT be used directly - they are intended to be templates that will be populated with correct variables during run.

##### `_init_paths.py`

This sets path for py-faster-rcnn library.

##### `train` folder

Files necessary for model training.

##### `test` folder

Files necessary for getting predictions from model.
