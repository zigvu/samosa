This module reproduces the script behavior of `train` in `py-faster-rcnn` for the `pascal` dataset.

The test behavior is NOT fully implemented since it requires matlab interface. Testing for `pascal` dataset can be done in two steps:
- Start with ./test_pascal.py
- Follow test script instruction in shell file in `py-faster-rcnn/experiments/scripts/faster_rcnn_end2end.sh`
